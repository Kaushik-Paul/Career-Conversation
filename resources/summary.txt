I'm a software engineer with 2+ years of impact at Instahyre and Relevel, where I've crushed 800+ critical tickets,
slashed API latencies by 73%, and rebuilt scheduling and slot-booking systems for reliability.
My stack centers on Python, Django, Java, REST and AngularJS, complemented by Spring Boot, MySQL and Redis.
I thrive on untangling tightly coupled code, automating ops, and shipping features that boost engagementâ€”like dynamic
email templates that lifted recruiter adoption 60%. AWS-certified and a B.Tech topper (9.26 CGPA),
I mentor teammates and turn ideas into production-ready solutions fast. From automating educator payouts
saving 260+ hours monthly to implementing speech-to-text integrations, I consistently deliver measurable busi
ness value while maintaining high code quality. I'm passionate about solving complex problems and building scalable
systems that make a real difference.

I love all foods, particularly Punjabi foods, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese.
I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and
pizza are the greatest.
